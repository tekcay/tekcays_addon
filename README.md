# TeK_CaY's Addon (TKCYA)

**TKCYA** adds new machines, multiblocks, mechanics and chains to **GregTech Community Edition Unofficial**.


TKCYA requires [**GregTech CE: Unofficial** **(GTCEu)**](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) and its corresponding dependency [**CodeChickenLib**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/codechicken-lib-1-8).

## Content (configurable):

### Overhauls
* Electrolysis overhaul: most recipes were removed, replaced by new ones that need electrodes which take damage
* Cracking overhaul: cracking now requires both temperature and pressure
* Storage overhaul: all of the quantum chest and tanks/super tanks are gone, and drums and multiblock tanks are nerfed. Multiblock tanks follow drum behavior and can only handle specific fluid depending upon the material they are made of. More drums and multiblock tanks can be made, e.g. in Galvanized Steel.
* Custom oregen: removed native metal ores, including iron, tin, gold, zinc and aluminium

### Components
* Magnetic: magnetic materials are made with magnetite in a new 2-slots Polarizer
* Foils: foils are made in the Cluster Mill
* Rotors: rotors are made in the Assembler, like in [**GT6**](https://github.com/GregTech6)

### New mechanics
* Heat system (HU), like in [**GT6**](https://github.com/GregTech6): can be generated by using electricity, solid, liquid or gas fuel
* Pressure system: can be generated by concentrating a large amount of a ``FluidStack`` in a machine.
* Rotation system: can be generated by Steam or Fuel in a steam turbine or a diesel generator.

### New multis
* Advanced Blast Furnace: only accepts HU, converts it to temperature.
* Pressurized Cracking Unit: processes the hydrocarbons generated from the petrochemistry with recipes involving specific
intervals of pressure and temperature.

### Chains:
* Wire coils from Mica ([**GCYL**](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/gregicality-legacy))
* Fluorine from Fluorite
* Chromium from Chromite ([**GCYL**](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/gregicality-legacy))
* Gold from Precious Metal ([**GCYL**](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/gregicality-legacy))
* Aluminium from Bauxite ([**GT6**](https://github.com/GregTech6))
* Zinc chain from Sphalerite (on-going)
