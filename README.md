# TeK_CaY's Addon (TKCYA)

**TKCYA** adds new machines, multiblocks, mechanics and chains to **GregTech Community Edition Unofficial**.


TKCYA requires [**GregTech CE: Unofficial** **(GTCEu)**](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) and its corresponding dependency [**CodeChickenLib**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/codechicken-lib-1-8).

## Content (configurable):

### Overhauls
* Electrolysis overhaul: most recipes were removed, replaced by new ones that need electrodes which take damage
* Cracking overhaul: cracking now requires both temperature and pressure
* Custom oregen: removed native metal ores, including iron, tin, gold, zinc and aluminium

* Storage overhaul:

    * all of the quantum chest and tanks/super tanks are removed
    * multiblock tanks follow drum behavior and can only handle specific fluid property depending upon the material they are made of
    * quantum chests are replaced by multiblock crates

### Components
* Their recipes need SolderingAlloy
* Magnetic: magnetic materials are made with magnetite in a new 2-slots Polarizer
* Foils: foils are made in the Cluster Mill
* Rotors: rotors are made in the Assembler, like in [**GT6**](https://github.com/GregTech6)

### New mechanics
* Heat system (HU), like in [**GT6**](https://github.com/GregTech6): can be generated by using electricity, solid, liquid or gas fuel
* Pressure system: can be generated by concentrating a large amount of a ``FluidStack`` in a machine.
* Rotation system: can be generated by Steam or Fuel in a steam turbine or a diesel generator.
* Amperage system: pretty close to what [**GTNH**](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons) does for some machines/recipes such *e.g* arc furnace, but for multiblocks.
  * The `amperage` property specifies the minimum amount of energy hatches input amperage required for a recipe to run. 
  * The `voltage` property specifies the voltage or the tier if you will of the input energy hatch.
  * as an example, with a recipe like this:
  
  ```
  MULTI_AMPERAGE_RECIPE_BUILDER_RECIPE_MAP.recipeBuilder()
    .fluidInputs(DistilledWater.getFluid(1000)) 
    .fluidOutputs(Hydrogen.getFluid(2000), Oxygen.getFluid(1000))
    .duration(100)
    .EUt(150)
    .voltageTier(GTValues.LV)
    .amperage(5)
    .buildAndRegister();
  ```
  
    * `5 A` means it needs at least 3 * `2 A` input energy hatches.
    * `LV` means that the aforementioned energy hatch must be `LV` tier.
  

* Logistic: ElectricPumps, FluidRegulators, ConveyorModules and RobotArms can only be placed on a new block: `LogisticMachine`.
It has an internal inventory including items, fluids and energy. Each operation executed by a cover drains energy: *e.g*
for a LV ConveyorModule extracting 1 item once, it drains 8 EU.

### New multis
* Advanced Blast Furnace: only accepts HU, converts it to temperature.
* Pressurized Cracking Unit: processes the hydrocarbons generated from the petrochemistry with recipes involving specific
intervals of pressure and temperature.

### Chains:
* Wire coils from Mica ([**GCYL**](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/gregicality-legacy))
* Fluorine from Fluorite
* Chromium from Chromite ([**GCYL**](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/gregicality-legacy))
* Gold from Precious Metal ([**GCYL**](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/gregicality-legacy))
* Aluminium from Bauxite ([**GT6**](https://github.com/GregTech6))
* Zinc chain from Sphalerite (on-going)
