# Gregicality Multiblocks

**Gregicality Multiblocks** adds many new multiblock machines to **GregTech Community Edition Unofficial** and is one module of Gregicality for GTCEu.


Every singleblock machine in GTCEu now has a **multiblock** variant capable of running up to **256** recipes simultaneously!


With this mod, playing without high tier machines in GregTech is now made possible, and allows the player to achieve _significant material processing power_ in existing and new playthroughs of GTCEu.


Additionally, this mod currently adds one multiblock power generator, with more to come in the future! The **Steam Engine** is an _inexpensive_ way to produce up to MV-Tier power. Perfect for powering your first Electric Blast Furnace!

 

This mod has a major config option determining how the mod plays. When the config is **on**, the mod aggressively gates higher voltages of the new multiblock machines, requiring a **Voltage Control Unit** of the appropriate tier. With this config **off (default)**, you can expect regular behavior with your energy hatches.
